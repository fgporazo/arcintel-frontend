To run an existing VUE JS project in your local environment, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install a Simple HTTP Server

Option 1: Using serve (npm package)
Install the serve package globally (if you don't have it already):
npm install -g serve
Navigate to the directory where your built files are located (where index.html and the associated js, css files are).
cd <path_to_your_built_project>
Start the server:
serve

Option 2: Using http-server (another npm package)

Step 2: Access the Project
If using serve: Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
If using http-server: Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
